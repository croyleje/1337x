# 1337x.to

1337x is a bash script for searching the *1337x.to* databases.  The default
settings are to search movies, the script is commented with examples to show
how this can be changed.

There are several scripts similar to this around but I have removed all the
dependencies on selectors such as rofi and dmenu.  The only dependencies are
- curl
- fzf
- transmission / transmission-remote

NOTE: I use transmission so I have also changed this and used a default user and
password see the comments in the scripts to change the user and password if you
are not using the defaults.  (And if you are they should be changed.)


## Usage
